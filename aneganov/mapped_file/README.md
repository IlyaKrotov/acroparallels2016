# Mapped file library

## author: Alexey Neganov <neganovalexey@gmail.com>

There is the implementation of the library to work with large file.

File _mapped_file.h_ contains library API; file ___mapped_file.h_ contains deprecated version of the API, useful for internal purposes.

See TODO for further information.
