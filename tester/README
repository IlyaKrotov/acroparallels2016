Tester Made by Denis Kopyrin
 This script goes through all dirs in ../ and makes cross-people tests
 Projects are expected to be built by make or cmake at $USERNAME/mapped_file/Makefile if you use make
or $USERNAME/mapped_file/CMakeLists.txt if you use cmake
 Tester calls make and cmake itself and expects to find libmappedfile.a at $USERNAME/mapped_file/out/
 Test files are build automatically and sources are expected to be at $USERNAME/mapped_file/test/
 Changing ROOT_LIB_DIR or ROOT_TEST_DIR can change lib dirs or test dirs respectively
like ROOT_LIB_DIR="../dkopyrin ../ivanov; ROOT_TEST_DIR="../sabramov ../osamara"
 CFLAGS are supported
